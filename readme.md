# Project 1
Project 1 consists of a simple and responsive login and sign up page. It is purely frontend and responsive across various devices and screen sizes. I have used CSS to add decorative elements to the page and make it easy for users to login and sign up. 

There is also elements for form validation to make sure that when users go to create an account, they are following the correct steps and meet all the requirements.

## How To Run
To run Project 1, make sure to save all of the files and run index.html

# Project 2
Project 2 consists of a simple and response login and sign up page with a backend. This backend allows users to create accounts and log in. This is done via a simple flask app and SQLAlchemy to store the username and passwords. 

When signing up, if a user enters an existing username, they are greeted with an error that tells them to use a different username. If the sign up is successful, they are taken to the login page where the can login. If they are unable to login, they are greeted with a message that tells them to double check their username and passwords to make sure they are correct. 

## How To Run
To run Project 2, make sure to save all of the files and download all of the requirements. After that, run app.py. Because this isn't published, it will run in the development environment, meaning the URL produced will only work locally.
